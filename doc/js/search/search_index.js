been moved from ngx-material-contacts to @angular-material-extensions/contacts\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\nBuilt by and for developers :heart:\nDo you have any question or suggestion ? Please do not hesitate to contact us!\nAlternatively, provide a PR | open an appropriate issue here\nIf did you like this project, support angular-material-extensions \nby starring :star: and sharing it :loudspeaker:\nTable of Contents\n\nDemo\nFeatures\nDependencies\nPeer Dependencies\nAdditional Requirements - material (Include a theme)\nAdditional Requirements - material icons\nInstallation\nUsage\nDocumentation\nRun Demo App Locally\nDevelopment\nOther Angular Libraries\nSupport\nLicense\n\n\n\nDemo\nView all the directives and components in action at https://angular-material-extensions.github.io/contacts\n\n\nFeatures\n\nDisplay contacts in a table including name, email, phone number and photo\nDelete a contact via event onContactRemoved\nAdd a contact via event onContactAdded\nValidation for adding a new contact incl. name, email and phone number form controls\n\n\n\nDependencies\n\nAngular - angular V7 is supported\n\n\n\nRequirements (peer dependencies) - please install the packages before using @angular-material-extensions/contacts:\n\nangular material theme\nangular material v7.x\nangular cdk v7.x\nangular animations v7.x\nangular forms v7.x\nangular flex-layout v7.0.0-beta.23\nng2-avatar\nif you need a built in theme --> please let me know\n\nbash\nnpm i @angular/cdk @angular/material @angular/flex-layout @angular/animations @angular/forms ng2-avatar\n\n\nAdditional requirements Theme (Material Design)\n\nangular material theme\n\n\n\nAdditional Requirements - Import the material design icons learn more\n\nThe easiest way to import material design icons is to provide a link in your index.html file like below:\n\n```html\n\n```\n\n\nalternative solution:\n\n\nInstall of the official npm module of the material design icons\n\nbash\nnpm i -s material-design-icons\n\nImport them in your angular.json file\n\njson\n\"styles\": [\n        \"styles.css\",\n        \"../node_modules/material-design-icons/iconfont/material-icons.css\"\n      ],  \n\n\n\nInstallation\nInstall above dependencies via npm. \nNow install @angular-material-extensions/contacts via:\nshell\nnpm install --save @angular-material-extensions/contacts\n\nSystemJS\n\nNote:If you are using SystemJS, you should adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.\nIn your systemjs config file, map needs to tell the System loader where to look for @angular-material-extensions/contacts:\n```js\nmap: {\n  '@angular-material-extensions/contacts': 'node_modules/@angular-material-extensions/contacts/bundles/@angular-material-extensions/contacts.umd.js',\n}\n\n```\nOnce installed you need to import the main module:\njs\nimport { MatContactsModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/contacts';\nThe only remaining part is to list the imported module in your application module. The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice MatContactsModule .forRoot()):\n```js\nimport { MatContactsModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/contacts';\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatContactsModule.forRoot(), ...],  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}\n```\nOther modules in your application can simply import MatContactsModule:\n```js\nimport { MatContactsModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/contacts';\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatContactsModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}\n```\n\n\nUsage\nadd the @angular-material-extensions/contacts element to your template:\nhtml\n\n\nin your component --> \ntypescript\nconst CONTACT_DATA: Contact[] = [\n  {\n    id: 'RnCSW7Y88iTx',\n    name: 'Anthony Nahas',\n    email: 'anthony.na@your_domain.com',\n    photoURL: '../../../assets/profiles/17p60.png',\n    phoneNumber: '+1-202-555-0169'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'KXgJviXd4EL9',\n    name: 'Amanda Lee',\n    email: 'amanda.lee@@angular-material-extensions/contacts.de',\n    photoURL: '../../../assets/profiles/1p60.png',\n    phoneNumber: '+1-502-555-0156'\n  }\n  ]\n```typescript\nexport class HomeComponent implements OnInit {\n  contacts = CONTACT_DATA;\n  ngOnInit() {\n      console.log('my contacts: ', this.contacts);\n    }\n  addContact(contact: Contact) {\n      console.log('on new contact: ', contact);\n      // do whatever you want with the added contact\n    }\nremoveContact(contact: Contact) {\n  console.log('on removed contact: ', contact);\n  // do whatever you want with the deleted contact\n}  }\n```\nContact's interface\ntypescript\nexport interface Contact {\n  id?: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  photoURL?: string;\n  phoneNumber?: string;\n}\n\n\nDocumentation\nPlease checkout the full documentation here \nor follow the official tutorial\n\n\nRun Demo App Locally\n\nclone this repo by running\nbash\n$ git clone https://github.com/angular-material-extensions/contacts.git\n\nlink the @angular-material-extensions/contacts package\nbash\n$ gulp link\n\nnavigate to the demo app directory\nbash\n$ cd demo\n\ninstall the dependencies\nbash\n$ npm i\n\nrun/start/serve the app\nbash\n$ npm run start\nor\nbash\n$ ng serve --open\n\nthe app is now hosted by http://localhost:4200/\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nclone this repo\nInstall the dependencies by running npm i\nbuild the library npm run build or gulp build\n\nbash\n$ npm run build\n4.
